# spotify-react-clone
This app is a demo clone of Spotify (using their spotify api) that I to created in order to learn React.


The live demo is available at (https://kitzx-spotify-clone.netlify.app).

Firebase only provides free acces for 30 days so, app's back-end might be not working when you're visitng it.


## note 
Spotify provided 30secs preview of the songs so we cannot hear the full audio. Its only a demo. Also some songs may not at all play because spotify provides only for some of them.
